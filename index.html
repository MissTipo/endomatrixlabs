        <h2>The challenge</h2>
        <p>
          Hormonal health is often reduced to menstrual tracking, despite hormones
          shaping energy, mood, skin, metabolism, cognition, and wellbeing across a
          woman’s entire life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most women receive fragmented information, late diagnoses, or dismissal of
          symptoms that are deeply connected to endocrine change.

        <h2>The endocrine digital twin</h2>
        <p>
          Our long-term vision is a living endocrine digital twin — a continuously
          evolving model that reflects how an individual’s hormonal system changes
          across life.
        </p>
        <p>
          This model is designed to support understanding, not diagnosis, and to act
          as a bridge between lived experience and clinical care.
